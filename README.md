# OBS Lightgun Flash Filter

OBS plugin that provides a flashing filter for lightgun games. Forked from the original implementation (https://github.com/puri-puri/OBS-Studio-Flash-Filter)
to provide a regular OBS plugin instead of requiring a modified OBS build.

Note that the filter requires tuning for each game to recognize the flashes correctly. It is very much recommended to try out the game ahead of time,
and adjust the filter color and threshold to make sure that it is effective in reducing flashing.
